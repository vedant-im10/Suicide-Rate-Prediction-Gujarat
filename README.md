# 📊 Suicide Rate Prediction: Uncovering the Hidden Patterns Behind the Numbers

**"Using Machine Learning to Understand the Impact of Societal Pressures"**

This project focuses on predicting suicide rates based on various socio-economic and demographic factors. By analyzing data from 2001 to 2012 for Gujarat, India, it identifies patterns and causes that contribute to suicide, providing insights that can help guide preventive measures. This project reflects both technical expertise and a commitment to using data science to address important societal challenges.

## 🌟 Project Motivation

Suicide is a complex issue influenced by societal pressures, personal struggles, and systemic failures. It remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, especially among young and middle-aged individuals. This project aims to use machine learning to uncover the key factors driving suicide and provide data-driven solutions to help prevent future tragedies.

The main goal is to turn data into actionable insights that can help mental health professionals, policymakers, and communities address the root causes of suicide.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **🧠 Predictive Modeling**: Uses **Linear Regression** to predict suicide rates based on factors like gender, occupation, age, and socio-economic status.
- **📈 Data Visualization**: Creates visualizations to help illustrate trends, patterns, and anomalies in the suicide data.
- **🔑 Root Cause Analysis**: Highlights important factors contributing to increased suicide rates and provides insights to help policymakers and mental health professionals take action.

## 🧬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data from multiple sources, including socio-demographic details and suicide statistics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values and selecting relevant features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in-depth analysis to find relationships, correlations, and trends in the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features that capture socio-economic pressures related to suicide rates.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - **Algorithm**: Used **Linear Regression** to predict suicide rates.
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Measured model performance using **R-squared**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
6. **Visualization**: Developed visualizations using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** to present findings clearly.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Rising Trends**: A significant increase in suicide rates was observed from 2001 to 2012, particularly among working-age males.
- **Gender Disparity**: Males showed higher suicide rates, often linked to economic pressures and unemployment.
- **Top Contributing Factors**: Major causes include financial stress, family problems, and job-related struggles, highlighting the need for targeted support.

## 🔬 Outcomes and Impact

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Provides a clear understanding of suicide trends, helping mental health professionals and policymakers develop targeted interventions.
- **Policy Implications**: Insights from the project can guide policy development to address the root causes of suicide.
- **Community Awareness**: Raises awareness of the societal issues that contribute to suicide, encouraging community-level prevention efforts.

## 🚀 Future Directions

- **Advanced Models**: Explore advanced algorithms like **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **Neural Networks** to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Real-Time Prediction Tool**: Develop a web-based tool to provide real-time predictions and trend analysis for researchers and policymakers.
- **Broaden Scope**: Expand the dataset to include more recent data and other regions, making the model more comprehensive.
